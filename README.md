### Project Description/Outline

Our project is to establish a relationship between the weather conditions and traffic collisions in NYC. We will examine collision frequency and rates throughout the year as the season and weather changes. If data and time permits, we will also examine the daily rates

### Research Questions to Answer

An investigation/ trends in of road accidents/collisions in NYC
Weather impact on the above
## Data Sets to be Used
- [NYC Traffic Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95 "NYC Traffic Data")
- [DarkSky Official API](https://darksky.net/dev "Dark Sky API")

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks

- Import raw data from NYC Public Data Set of Motor Vehicle Collisions
- Clean Raw data by Recatgeorizing accidents, removing duplicates, and incomplete data
(Required Data, Accident Date, Time, Location)
- Create API Link to Dark Sky and Feed coordinates and dates into API to return Weather Conditions
- Append conditions to Data Set
- Create Graphs to showcase results
- Analyze Results by establishing trends, statistical significance, and summarize conclusions.
- Create Power Point Presentation
